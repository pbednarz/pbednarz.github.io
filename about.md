I work as the Android Developer in PGS Software mobiles application team.
This is my personal blog where I want to share my experience and learn markdown language myself.

Currently I am super busy with my studies at weekends (at Rzesz√≥w University of Technology) where I am finishing my master degree. So more stuff will come later on summer holidays.
